LibreOffice Conf. Asia & UbuCon Asia 2023 (LOUCA23) is over. Thanks to all parties involved in the excitement of this event. About 382 participants (excluding organizers, volunteers and speakers) attended this event. The number of participants was dominated by students (51%) and the rest came from the general public and practitioners. This percentage are what organizers expected, we hope they will be new contributors in the future after joining LOUCA23.

In this two-day activity on 7 & 8 October 2023, there were 45 speakers from various countries; Indonesia, Malaysia, Timor Leste, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India and Germany. Each speakers fills in the schedule track according to the schedule that has been announced. Session documentation from each speakers will likely be uploaded periodically over the next few months.

The excitement of LOUCA23 in Surakarta certainly could not have happened without the help of volunteers from various open source communities in Indonesia; including the Solo Linux Community (PLiS), Kelompok Linux Arek Surabaya (KLAS), Linux Nurul Fikri (Linux NF Depok), and the PTIK (Himakoptik) student association. Apart from special swag for volunteers, LibreOffice ID also gives special appreciation to MVP volunteer LOUCA23. Big Thanks!
